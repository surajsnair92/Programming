Programming Assignment 1:

Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path and Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree.


1) For running DijkstraAlgo.java, please change the input file accordingly. The relative path can be given inside FileReader(“path”). 
(line 17 in DijkstraAlgo.java)

2) the variable start represents the start index from where the shortest path with respect to each node is calculated. In case you want to change this please check line 14 in DijkstraAlgo.java.
